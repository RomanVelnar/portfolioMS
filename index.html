									<h2>Work</h2>

								<p>
									Working with people has always been the core of my professional career. I started with entertainment and teaching dance lessons as a teenager, which lead me to hospitality, marketing, public relations and event management. All of these positions required team working abilities, excellent interpersonal skills and flexibility. When being put in a leading position, I have no problems with leadership, self-awareness or problem solving. During the years I developed a strong sense for high quality service, which is my main goal at any task.
									On a more personal level, dedication to performance and dancing has shaped my outstanding determination, detail-orientation, patience and internal drive to always give my best effort. I am very empathetic and take pleasure in passing my knowledge and teaching others. On top of that, my other personal traits are honesty, reliability, empathy and loyalty.
									My belief in the need for constant education and professional, as well as personal growth, is the main driving force behind my curriculum. I enjoy taking different educational courses and putting myself in a challenging environment, full of possibilities to grow and improve. Through the years this has made me able to quickly learn and adapt to new situations and cope well under pressure.
